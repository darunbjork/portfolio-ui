Week 2, Day 7 — Dashboard Finalization

🎯 Milestone Achieved

Completed a full-featured CMS with:

Skills/Experience CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
Type-safe forms after fixing any type violations
"Add New" capability for Skills (previously missing)

💡 Key Improvements

TypeScript Robustness
Fixed in DebugInfo.tsx and SkillForm.tsx:
// Before (unsafe)
const handleError = (error: any) => {...}

// After (type-safe)
const handleError = (error: AxiosError) => {...}
Feature Completion
Added "Add New Skill" button + creation logic
Unified form behavior across all models
UX Polish
Smart date handling for experience entries
Auto-disable "To Date" when "Current Role" is checked
✅ Verified Functionality

✔️ Full CRUD cycles for Skills & Experience
✔️ Real-time sync with public views (/skills, /experience)
✔️ Tabbed dashboard navigation

🔒 Security

All mutations require valid JWT
Axios interceptors enforce auth headers
🧪 Testing

Type Safety: Confirmed linter passes with strict types
Edge Cases: Tested date logic and empty states
End-to-End: Verified public/private view synchronization
