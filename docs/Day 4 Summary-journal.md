Week 2, Day 4 — Frontend Authentication & System Health
🎯 Today's Achievements

Auth System Implementation
Built login/register forms with Zustand state management
Configured Axios interceptors for JWT handling
Implemented localStorage session persistence
Component Quality Audit
Verified 100% component functionality
Fixed layout inconsistencies across all pages
Centralized type definitions in src/types/
Code Quality Improvements
Resolved all 16 ESLint/TypeScript errors
Eliminated any types with proper error handling
Removed unused variables from test components
💡 Key Design Decisions

Authentication Architecture

Option Choice Rationale Tradeoff
State Lib Zustand Minimal boilerplate Less dev tools
Storage localStorage Simple implementation Less secure than HttpOnly
Token Attach Axios Interceptor Centralized logic Global error handling needed
Type Safety Approach

// Before (risky)
catch (err: any) { ... }

// After (safe)
catch (err: unknown) {
if (isApiError(err)) {
err.response.data.message // Type-safe access
}
}

✅ Verified Functionality

Authentication
