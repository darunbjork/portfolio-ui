Week 2, Day 5 — Admin Dashboard & Critical Fixes
🎯 Today's Achievements

Admin Dashboard Foundation
Implemented ProtectedRoute for secure access
Built tabbed UI for content management
Created fully functional CreateProjectForm
Critical Bug Fixes
Resolved 4 production-impacting issues
Eliminated type safety vulnerabilities
Fixed SSR compatibility problems
💡 Key Design Decisions

Security Architecture

Component Solution Rationale
ProtectedRoute Wrapper component Centralized auth logic
Form Errors Type-safe handling Prevents runtime crashes
localStorage SSR-safe access Universal app support

Type Safety Upgrades

// Before (risky)
catch (err) {
toast.error(err.message);
}

// After (safe)
catch (err: unknown) {
const message = (err as ApiError)?.response?.data?.message
|| 'Operation failed';
toast.error(message);
}

🛠️ Fixed Issues

1. Component Conflicts

Removed duplicate CreateProjectForm declarations in Dashboard
Streamlined component organization 2. Type Safety

Eliminated any types in error handling
Added proper TypeScript interfaces 3. Data Integrity

Prevented empty strings in technologies array
// Before
technologies: [''] // Invalid

// After
technologies: technologies.filter(tech => tech.trim())
